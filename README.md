# ultra-fast-colab-setup-no-pip
I just DELETED pip dependencies, then the requirements.txt, PIP ITSELF, **EVEN THE PROGRAM ITSELF**, TAKING INSTALL TIME FROM 17:15 MINUTES DOWN TO 2:30 MINUTES, **AND IT STILL WORKED!!!** This is an ULTRA fast installation script for Google Colab that installs in TWO MINUTES! No Pip install, no requirements.txt file, no waiting half an hour!
