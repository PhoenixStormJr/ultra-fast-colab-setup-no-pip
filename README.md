# ultra-fast-colab-setup-no-pip
I just DELETED pip dependencies, then the requirements.txt, PIP ITSELF, **EVEN THE PROGRAM ITSELF**, TAKING INSTALL TIME FROM 17:15 MINUTES DOWN TO 2:30 MINUTES, **AND IT STILL WORKED!!!** This is an ULTRA fast installation script for Google Colab that installs in TWO MINUTES! No Pip install, no requirements.txt file, no waiting half an hour!

(Will upload the demo colab notebook in a second!)


I got sick of Colab EATING my GPU time while installing 4,000 packages that are all WORTHLESS so I decided to... optimize! I said SCREW YOU PIP, WE'LL INSTALL WITHOUT YOU!!!

Pip? It died (Be sad)

requirements.txt? ROASTED!

torch, numpy, scikit-learn, ffmpeg, fairseq matplotlib? ALL ZIPPED AND CLONED!

AND THE PROGRAM STILL WORKED!!!

Every bloated and useless "dependency" now a single zip file THAT WORKS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL! No "install" just "UNZIP!"

‚úÖ Install time: 17 mins ‚Üí 2 mins
‚úÖ Training speed: 25s/epoch ‚Üí 11s/epoch
‚úÖ No dependency errors. No bloat. No mercy.
‚úÖ RVC runs. Models train. Life is good.

This isn't just for RVC. You can use it for ANY colab notebook! Installation times DRASTICALLY reduced!

So stop wasting your GPU hours on install hell.

üíæ Just unzip.

üßü Run the zombies (zip file).

‚ò†Ô∏è And kill your requirements.txt.
