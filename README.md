# ultra-fast-colab-setup-no-pip
I just DELETED pip dependencies, then the requirements.txt, PIP ITSELF, **EVEN THE PROGRAM ITSELF**, TAKING INSTALL TIME FROM 17:15 MINUTES DOWN TO 2:30 MINUTES, **AND IT STILL WORKED!!!** This is an ULTRA fast installation script for Google Colab that installs in TWO MINUTES! No Pip install, no requirements.txt file, no waiting half an hour!

Notebook showing setup: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PhoenixStormJr/ultra-fast-colab-setup-no-pip/blob/main/ultra_fast_colab_setup_no_pip.ipynb

Example notebook with super fast installation: https://colab.research.google.com/github/PhoenixStormJr/RVC-v2-easy-GUI-glitches-fixed/blob/main/EasyGUI_minimal_install_%F0%9F%8E%AE_10_02_2024__8.ipynb

I got sick of Colab EATING my GPU time while installing 4,000 packages that are all WORTHLESS so I decided to... optimize! I said SCREW YOU PIP, WE'LL INSTALL WITHOUT YOU!!!

Pip? It died (Be sad)

requirements.txt? ROASTED!

torch, numpy, scikit-learn, ffmpeg, fairseq matplotlib? ALL ZIPPED AND CLONED!

AND THE PROGRAM STILL WORKED!!!

Every bloated and useless "dependency" now a single zip file THAT WORKS BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL! No "install" just "UNZIP!"

‚úÖ Install time: 17 mins ‚Üí 2 mins
‚úÖ Training speed: 25s/epoch ‚Üí 11s/epoch
‚úÖ No dependency errors. No bloat. No mercy.
‚úÖ RVC runs. Models train. Life is good.

This isn't just for RVC. You can use it for ANY colab notebook! Installation times DRASTICALLY reduced!

So stop wasting your GPU hours on install hell.

üíæ Just unzip.

üßü Run the zombies (zip file).

‚ò†Ô∏è And kill your requirements.txt.

(Off topic, Jesus loves you, and died for your sins. Don't listen to corrupt Mega Churches with all these rules, Jesus said in Matthew 22:38-40: "This is the great and first commandment. And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Meaning LOVE is the only commandment. Please join Jesus's TRUE family (not the evil Jesus of Mega Churches) and join his love today! Jesus loves you, God Bless! üòÑ)
